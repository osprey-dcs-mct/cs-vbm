# MCT VBM Vertical Coordinate System IOC

This IOC implements the vertical coordinate system for the MCT VBM.

## Overview

### Axes

The coordinate system axes are:
- vertical
- pitch
- roll

The physical axes are:
- upstream inboard
- upstream outboard
- downstream

### Records 

One transform record is used to perform the control actions, converting the
requested coordinate system setpoints to the required physical motor positions
using the inverse kinematic equations.

A second transform record performs forward kinematic calculations from the motor
positions to give real time indication of the coordinate system axis positions.

#### Synchronization

A synchronization record triggers updates of the transform record setpoints to
align them with the current coordinate system axis positions. This is used if
the motors have been moved manually.

#### Move completion

`busy` records are used to implement the move completion functionality. Any
client that writes to a coordinate system axis setpoint with a Channel Access putCallback request will block until the move has completed.

```console
caput -c -w 10 MCT:VBM:CS_Y:linr 4
